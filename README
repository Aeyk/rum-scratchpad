* Rum Scratchpad

This is a place for me to put little [[https://aeyk.github.io/rum-scratchpad/music.html][web experiments in Rum and Clojure.]] 

This was a lot of fun, as the page says, left half of keyboard is chords and right hand is indiv. notes.
It uses [[https://github.com/piranha/keybind][keybind]] and [[https://github.com/tonsky/rum][rum]] under the hood.

** Installation 

in the root directory of the project I've bundled pre-compiled units so you can simply open music.html in a web 
browser of your choice and expore the demo.
